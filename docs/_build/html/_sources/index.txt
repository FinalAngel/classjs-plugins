These plugins are aimed for professionals with extensive JavaScript knowledge.
Each plugin follows a simplistic and a modular approach.

The plugins are compatible with Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE7+. We also support iOS, Android and Windows Phone to
insure correct responsive behaviour with full accessible support according to the WCAG 2.0 standards.
Each plugin requires at least class.js 1.0+ and jQuery 1.7+.
